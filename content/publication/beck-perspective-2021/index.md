abstract: This work presents a review of the current state of research in data‐driven
  turbulence closure modeling. It offers a perspective on the challenges and open
  issues but also on the advantages and promises of machine learning (ML) methods
  applied to parameter estimation, model identification, closure term reconstruction,
  and beyond, mostly from the perspective of large Eddy simulation and related techniques.
  We stress that consistency of the training data, the model, the underlying physics,
  and the discretization is a key issue that needs to be considered for a successful
  ML‐augmented modeling strategy. In order to make the discussion useful for non‐experts
  in either field, we introduce both the modeling problem in turbulence as well as
  the prominent ML paradigms and methods in a concise and self‐consistent manner.
  In this study, we present a survey of the current data‐driven model concepts and
  methods, highlight important developments, and put them into the context of the
  discussed challenges.
