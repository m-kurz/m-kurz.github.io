abstract: Modern turbomachinery relies on accurate prediction of the flow and especially
  the state of turbulence to achieve the required level of performance. Transition,
  relaminarization, wake interactions, and interrow influence form complex, highly
  unsteady flow patterns. Large eddy simulation (LES) emerges as a promising method
  to deliver improved accuracy over Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) approaches
  as the major energy-carrying scales are fully resolved. However, for wall-bounded
  flows, modeling of (parts of) the boundary layer might still be inevitable to keep
  the computational costs manageable. In this paper, we aim to characterize and analyze
  the boundary-layer state in such a scenario. We employ the high-order discontinuous
  Galerkin spectral element method to perform a wall-resolved LES of a stator-rotor-stator
  cascade (Ma up to 0.65, Re up to 8.0×105). The interfaces between the blade rows
  are treated with a high-order accurate sliding mesh approach. Time-averaged performance
  characteristics are compared against experimental and numerical data. The temporal
  evolution of the solution is first assessed through the phase-averaged flowfield
  at different stator-rotor positions. Subsequently, special emphasis is placed on
  the spatiotemporal evolution of turbulence near the blade surface. Boundary-layer
  profile and energy spectra analysis are used to give insight into the turbulence
  development. This investigation not only reveals the complexities of the boundary-layer
  dynamics but can also serve as benchmark and reference for evaluation and development
  of wall-modeled LES approaches for turbomachinery applications.
