abstract: 'This paper summarizes our progress in the application and improvement of
  a high order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for scale resolving fluid dynamics
  simulations towards robust and flexible industrial applications. We report the results
  obtained on the Cray XC40 Hazel Hen cluster at HLRS and show code performance. We
  present three application cases and developments: An implicit time integration scheme
  for split-form DG schemes allows us to solve stiff problems with increased efficiency,
  which will open up new classes of problems for simulations with FLEXI. We follow
  this by discussing a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of a compressible turbulent boundary
  layer and provide comparison to DNS data. Lastly, we demonstrate how to extend the
  high order scheme with a consistent and conservative sliding mesh interface, and
  present results of a 1.5 stage turbine simulation with wall-resolved LES.'
