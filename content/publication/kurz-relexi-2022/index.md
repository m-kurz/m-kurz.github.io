abstract: Relexi is an open source reinforcement learning (RL) framework written in
  Python and based on TensorFlow’s RL library TF-Agents. Relexi allows to employ RL
  for environments that require computationally intensive simulations like applications
  in computational fluid dynamics. For this, Relexi couples legacy simulation codes
  with the RL library TF-Agents at scale on modern high-performance computing (HPC)
  hardware using the SmartSim library. Relexi thus provides an easy way to explore
  the potential of RL for HPC applications.
