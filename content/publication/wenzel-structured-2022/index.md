abstract: Standard kernel methods for machine learning usually struggle when dealing
  with large datasets. We review a recently introduced Structured Deep Kernel Network
  (SDKN) approach that is capable of dealing with high-dimensional and huge datasets
  - and enjoys typical standard machine learning approximation properties.
