abstract: In the present work, we investigate the stability of turbulence closure
  predictions from neural network models and highlight the role of model-data-inconsistency
  during inference. We quantify this inconsistency by applying the Mahalanobis distance
  and demonstrate that the instability of the model predictions in practical large
  eddy simulations (LES) correlates with a deviation of the input data between the
  training dataset and actual simulation data. Moreover, the method of &#39;stability
  training&#39; is applied to increase the robustness of recurrent artificial neural
  networks (ANN) against small perturbations in the input, which are typically unavoidable
  in any practical scenario. We show that this method can increase the stability of
  simulations with ANN-based closure term predictions significantly. The models also
  achieve good accuracy on the blind testing set in comparison to the baseline model
  trained without stability training. The work presented here can thus be seen as
  a building block towards long-term stable data-driven models for dynamical systems
  and highlights methods to detect and counter model-data-inconsistencies.
