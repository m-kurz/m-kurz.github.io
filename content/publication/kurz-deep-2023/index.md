abstract: Over the last years, supervised learning (SL) has established itself as
  the state-of-the-art for data-driven turbulence modeling. In the SL paradigm, models
  are trained based on a dataset, which is typically computed a priori from a high-fidelity
  solution by applying the respective filter function, which separates the resolved
  and the unresolved flow scales. For implicitly filtered large eddy simulation (LES),
  this approach is infeasible, since here, the employed discretization itself acts
  as an implicit filter function. As a consequence, the exact filter form is generally
  not known and thus, the corresponding closure terms cannot be computed even if the
  full solution is available. The reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm can be used
  to avoid this inconsistency by training not on a previously obtained training dataset,
  but instead by interacting directly with the dynamical LES environment itself. This
  allows to incorporate the potentially complex implicit LES filter into the training
  process by design. In this work, we apply a reinforcement learning framework to
  find an optimal eddy-viscosity for implicitly filtered large eddy simulations of
  forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence. For this, we formulate the task of turbulence
  modeling as an RL task with a policy network based on convolutional neural networks
  that adapts the eddy-viscosity in LES dynamically in space and time based on the
  local flow state only. We demonstrate that the trained models can provide long-term
  stable simulations and that they outperform established analytical models in terms
  of accuracy. In addition, the models generalize well to other resolutions and discretizations.
  We thus demonstrate that RL can provide a framework for consistent, accurate and
  stable turbulence modeling especially for implicitly filtered LES.
