  #      üî≠   I‚Äôve always been driven by a blend of scientific curiosity and technical challenges.

  #      üåü   I thrive on the synergy between science and number crunching‚Äîwhether it's optimizing algorithms for novel HPC systems, implementing cutting-edge numerical methods or using machine learning to rethink traditional simulations.

  #      üöÄ   In recent years, I've applied HPC to enable large-scale CFD simulations of turbulent flows and explored how machine learning can be used to develop smarter, data-driven turbulence models for large eddy simulation.

  #      üìù   Along the way, I‚Äôve contributed to several open-source projects both inside and outside these fields.

  #      üí¨   If you're into CFD, HPC, or the fusion of machine learning and simulation, feel free to reach out!
